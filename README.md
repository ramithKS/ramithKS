### About me:

Hey there! As a firm believer in thinking big, I'm always looking for ways to make a positive impact in the world. That's why I'm currently working as a co-founder and CEO of JustPoll, a social media app for both iOS and Android that empowers users to share their thoughts and get valuable feedback from others using hashtags, audio, images, and video.

With a keen understanding of technology and a proven track record of developing successful products, I enjoy motivating my team to work hard and achieve our goals. At JustPoll, we're committed to delivering a top-notch user experience and serving the wider community with our innovative product.

Outside of work, I enjoy creating content to share my knowledge and experience with others. Whether it's in the tech industry or beyond, I'm always looking for ways to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see where my next challenge takes me.
